# Todoey âœ“

Todoey is a simple to-do list app. 

## How does it work?

The application is made up of two screens: category list view and item list view. First, once you open the app, you can click the add button and make a new category. Then, inside the category, you can create to-do items and check each item to mark them as done or simply swipe them left to delete. 
The application uses MVC design pattern and Realm as the database. In order to make UITableView cells swipeable, SwipeCellKit framework was installed. Also, to assign a random color to a newly created category cell, Chameleon color framework was installed. This framework is also used to create gradient colors for items in a category and a contrasting color for navigation bar title and bar button.
